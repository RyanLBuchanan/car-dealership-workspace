Certainly! Here are some comments for this code:

```java
package car_dealership;

public class Customer {

    // Private instance variables for the customer's name, address, and cash on hand
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private double cashOnHand;

    // Getters and setters for the customer's name, address, and cash on hand
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    // Setter for the customer's address that adds " Dealership City" to the end
    public void setAddress(String address) {
        address += " Dealership City";
        this.address = address;
    }

    public double getCashOnHand() {
        return cashOnHand;
    }

    // Setter for the customer's cash on hand that adds $500 to it
    public void setCashOnHand(double cashOnHand) {
        cashOnHand += 500;
        this.cashOnHand = cashOnHand;
    }

    // Method for the customer to purchase a car from the dealership
    public void purchaseCar(Vehicle vehicle, Employee emp, boolean finance) {
        emp.handleCustomer(this, finance, vehicle);
    }
}
```

I hope these comments help clarify what each part of the code is doing! Let me know if you have any questions.
